About Project:
This project is based upon the space shooter game which uses the concepts of Object Oriented Programming like inheritance, polymorphism, association, aggregation and composition.

Graphical user Interface:
This project uses the sfml library for the graphical user interface in order to provide an immersive gaming experience. The space shooter game is made more visually appealing and functional by the use of sfml (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library), which offers a strong framework for managing graphics, window management, and other multimedia elements.
